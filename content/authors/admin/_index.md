    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a software developer currently studying ICT engineering at the Tampere University of Applied Sciences. I have a passion for learning systems in depth, including security and hardware perspectives. I think it is pertinent to have knowledge how systems are built from ground up. For over two decades I have gained extensive knowledge in different fields of ICT. Even though I'm mainly Linux user and a FOSS (free and open source software) advocate I do know my way around with commercial products and Microsoft, Android and Apple operating systems as well.
